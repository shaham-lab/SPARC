# SPARC: Spectral Architectures Tackling the Cold-Start Problem in Graph Learning


## Overview
This is the official PyTorch implementation of SPARC from the paper "SPARC: Spectral Architectures Tackling the Cold-Start Problem in Graph Learning" [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01532).

SPARC is a novel graph learning framework designed to handle **cold-start nodes** using **generalizable spectral embeddings**.  
It enhances state-of-the-art graph models by enabling predictions on **new, unseen nodes** without adjacency information.

## Architecture Overview
### SPARC Framework
- Training Phase: The neural network learns spectral embeddings from adjacency-based Laplacian eigenfunctions.
- Inference Phase: Cold-start nodes are mapped to spectral space without adjacency information.

### SPARC Model Variants
- SPARC-GCN: Integrates spectral embeddings into GCN-based models.
- SPARCphormer: A transformer-based approach for large graphs.
- SAMBA: Utilizes state-space models for efficient graph learning.


## Features
- **Cold-Start Node Support**: Predicts on new nodes without retraining.
- **Scalable**: Works on large graphs.
- **State-of-the-Art Accuracy**: Outperforms baseline models on cold-start classification, clustering, and link prediction.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements & Installation

To set up SPARC, ensure you have installed Python 3.x. Then, install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install [METIS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54326406/how-to-install-metis-library-for-python)

#### Input format
As input, the code requires that a graph is in GraphSAGE format, the option is specified which specifies the following data files:

| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `<train_prefix>-G.json` | NetworkX JSON file describing the graph. Nodes contain `val` and `test` attributes. |
| `<train_prefix>-id_map.json` | Maps graph node IDs to consecutive integers. |
| `<train_prefix>-class_map.json` | Maps graph node IDs to classes. |
| `<train_prefix>-feats.npy` (optional) | Numpy array of node features. If absent, identity features are used. |

## Usage

To use SPARC embeddings on graphs, `cd` to src directory and run the following:

```bash
python main.py config/cora|pubmed|citeseer|reddit|Amazon2M.json
```
